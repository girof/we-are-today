A simple-ish C++ program using <windows.h> that changes your desktop when ran to the corresponding version of https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GlNWvxRxFA/maxresdefault.jpg. 

Currently, the wallpapers have to be placed in `C:\Users\Public\wallpaper-changer\wallpapers`, as I'm (currently) too busy to actually include the images in the executable and whatnot.

Recommended to put it in your startup programs for a seamless experience.
